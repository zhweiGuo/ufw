# smoke tests for running in a container. Note: as of 2020-03-02, Debian
# CI does not provide isolation-machine, but isolation-container doesn't work
# on (at least) arm64. While we can simply run tests in a VM prior to upload,
# attempt running modified tests (ie, where ip_tables and ip6_tables are
# are loaded in the kernel) with isolation-container on amd64 (the test will
# verify the arch) since isolation-container appears to work there. If this
# results in a flaky test, we might need to remove this and wait for
# isolation-machine to become available
